## Game Description
The memory game is a classic card matching game where players have to flip cards to find pairs. The game includes a deck of cards with different symbols or images on the front. Players can select two cards at a time, and if they match, the cards remain open. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back over. The objective is to match all the cards with the fewest number of moves.
